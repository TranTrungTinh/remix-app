This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/(vfinal)/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

A raw version of the app, without any feature from the course,
is available at [http://localhost:3000/v1](http://localhost:3000).

The code for this raw version is located in the "v1" folders.
